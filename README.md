# FAQ Development Exercise

#### **User Story** 
As an Administrator User Iâ€™d like the ability to manage questions
and answers and have them displayed to end users on a FAQ
page so that I can answer commonly asked questions.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Admins should be able to create, update and delete questions and answers.
2. End Users should be able to view these questions and answers.
